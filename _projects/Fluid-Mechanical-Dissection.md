As part of my Introduction to Fluid Mechanics class, we dismantled an old chainsaw. Unfortunately, the chain itself was not still attached when we received it, so it was closer to a two-stroke engine that may or may not have been used to run a chainsaw in its past. My portion of the project dealt primarily with inspecting the cylinder of the engine, a major part of a two-stroke engine, and where the "two-stroke" in the name comes from. We dismantled the chainsaw as a whole, and then I took charge in analzying the structure and function of the piston-cylinder assembly in relation to the carburetor, fuel tank, and exhaust. I found the physics of the piston operation to be fairly simple and straightforward, although the structure of this assembly was quite different from my preconceptions of a two-stroke cylinder design. You can find our video, presenting our findings and analysis of the engine here: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2zX-fvSyLw)
